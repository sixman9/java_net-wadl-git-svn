    <h3>WADL v. ${version}</h3>
    <p>
      WADL is designed to provide a simple alternative to WSDL for use
      with XML/HTTP Web applications. To date such applications have
      been mainly described using a combination of textual description
      and XML schema, WADL aims to provide a machine process-able
      description of such applications in a simpler format than is
      possible using WSDL.
