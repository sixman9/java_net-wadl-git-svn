  WADL v. ${version}

   WADL is designed to provide a simple alternative to WSDL for use with
   XML/HTTP Web applications. To date such applications have been mainly
   described using a combination of textual description and XML schema, WADL
   aims to provide a machine process-able description of such applications in
   a simpler format than is possible using WSDL.

   This distribution contains the following files:

   ./bin
           Scripts for running the commandline tool.

   ./lib
           The libraries required to run the commandline tools and the Ant
           task.

   ./samples
           Some examples, showing how to use the different tools provided.
